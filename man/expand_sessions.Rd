\usage{
expand_sessions(
  hyfe_data,
  unit = "hour",
  timestamp_start = NULL,
  timestamp_stop = NULL,
  tz = NULL,
  create_table = TRUE,
  create_series = FALSE,
  inactive_value = 0,
  verbose = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{hyfe_data}{A standard \code{hyfe_data} object downloaded
from the Research Dashboard (for external partners) or from \code{hyferdrive} (internal analysts).
See full details and examples in the \href{https://hyfe-ai.github.io/hyfer/#hyfedata}{package vignette}.}

\item{unit}{The time unit to use. If \code{hour} (default), a table will be created with
one row for each hour of day; if \code{day}, each row will represent a single date.}

\item{tz}{If \code{NULL} (the default), this function will look within the \code{cohort_settings} slot of the
\code{hyfe_data} object for the timezone to use. If not found there, the assumption will be \code{UTC}.}

\item{verbose}{Print status updates?}
}
\value{
A list with \code{timetable} (a dataframe with one row per person-date or person-hour)
and \code{series} (a dataframe in which each row is a timestamp, and each column is a UID).
By default, series is returned as a NULL object since it is usually only needed
for troubleshooting and can be time-consuming to prepare.
}
\description{
Expand a \code{sessions} dataframe (one row per session) into a dataframe with one row per person-date,
with time recorded on that date. This function handles the messiness of
getting the amount of time recorded for a specific person on a specific day
(since a session start on day 1 and ending on day 3 means that all of day 2 was recorded)
}
\details{
Most analyses of Hyfe data hinge upon detailed knowledge of when
Hyfe was actively listening for coughs, and when it wasnâ€™t.
To determine the duration of monitoring on an hourly or daily basis,
use the \code{expand_sessions()} function.
